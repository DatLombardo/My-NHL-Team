1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction
---
For our final project, we have decided to create an NHL fan page. This application allows a user to register their favourite team, and view their teams' current place in the standings. Also the user will get an overview of the performance of all players, as well as tables including the top 3 players, and the teams' goalies.

Recommendations for this project's environment include a full-screen display (*15 inch+*), to avoid obscuring the d3 visualization.
